excerpt: In this blog post I want to share my top 3 ways of learning a language in a motivating way.

###1. Use Tandem - https://www.tandem.net/de
It is an app to meet new people that talk the language you want to learn and you can teach them your mother tongue.
The app will automatically search for people that match your language learning criteria. 

In the app you have also the possibility to video chat or exchange voice message and when chatting the possibility to correct
messages on the fly.

![tandem](./tandem.png "For the paid version (it's really affordable) you even have a built in translator to more easily communicate with your 
                          tandem partners.")

You also have the possibility to find dedicated teachers that will help you with learning your language in no time!


###2. Translate songs and sing along

Here there are 3 Levels you can try out:

Let's assume you want to learn spanish.

**Level 1:**
Take a spanish song and translate it word by word. Now you sing along the song 
and try to remember the meaning and the translations

**Level 2:**  
Try to translate back your translation to the original language without looking into the original song

**Level 3**:  
Don't look the song text up but try to write it down from all you can hear.


![sing](./sing.jpg "Another fun exercise could be to write a new song, short story or poem with the words that you have learnt! :)")


###3. Travel & Cheat

Cheating is definitely allowed. 

![note](./sticky-note.jpg "Prepare for your next trip by writing everything
                            you need to know down on a paper just like you would do when cheating for a test")

Then when you will talk to people take your paper with you and use it for the conversation. After a short amount of time
you will recognize that you don't need it anymore!

###4. FluentU - https://www.fluentu.com


![fluentU](./fluentU.png "FluentU is an app that let's you learn a language by watching real life videos like music videos, funny videos or movie scenes.")

It costs 20 USD per month but is definitely worth a try if you want to invest some money.
The advandtage here is that you start learning a language from real people talking their language in a natural way.
You can pause every video and rewatch as often as you like. The best functionality from FluentU is definitely the subtitles that will translate
every word with an explanational image (to better remember the word) as soon as you hover over the word.


Those were some of my ideas.
Maybe you have some more you can just post them in the comments below!
